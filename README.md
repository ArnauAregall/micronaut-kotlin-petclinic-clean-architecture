[![Build Gradle project](https://github.com/ArnauAregall/micronaut-kotlin-petclinic-clean-architecture/actions/workflows/build-gradle-project.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ArnauAregall/micronaut-kotlin-petclinic-clean-architecture/actions/workflows/build-gradle-project.yml)

Sample repository to explore microservices architecture patterns using Micronaut and Kotlin while following **clean architecture/ports and adapters**.

Tech stack:

- Kotlin
- Gradle
- Micronaut
- Postgres
- Apache Kafka
- Keycloak
- Docker
- Testcontainers

The goal is to mimic the well known project [Spring PetClinic](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/) but using Micronaut and following a distributed architecture design.
